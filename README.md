**🔍 Exact and Fuzzy Word Matching Algorithm 🎯**

Welcome to the repository containing a **Python implementation** of an approach called the **Exact and Fuzzy Word Matching Algorithm!** 🚀 This tool is designed to accurately compare responses generated by large language models (LLMs) against benchmark answers, helping you measure how well they perform.

**🧠 Description**

This algorithm evaluates how well LLM-generated responses match key predefined keywords from benchmark answers by combining **exact** and **fuzzy** string matching techniques. Here’s how it works:
	•	✨ **Preprocessing**: Converts keywords to lowercase and removes extra spaces for consistency.
	•	🔤 **Tokenization**: Extracts valid words from the response text using regex, ignoring case differences.
	•	✅ **Exact Matching**: Looks for direct, word-to-word matches between keywords and the tokenized text.
	•	🔍 **Fuzzy Matching**: For keywords not found exactly, uses the powerful RapidFuzz library to calculate similarity scores based on Levenshtein distance. Matches above a threshold are accepted!
	•	📊 **Scoring**: Calculates the final matching percentage by dividing the number of matched keywords by the total keywords.

This hybrid approach boosts the evaluation’s robustness by handling minor typos and spelling variations — all while keeping precision intact! 🎯

🚀 **Usage**
	•	📝 **Input**: A list of benchmark keywords and the LLM’s generated response text.
	•	🎯 **Output**: A matching score showing the percentage of keywords found in the response.

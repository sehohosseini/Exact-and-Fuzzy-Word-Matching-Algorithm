Exact and Fuzzy Word Matching Algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of a novel approach called the Exact and Fuzzy Word Matching Algorithm, designed to improve the accuracy of comparing responses generated by large language models (LLMs) against benchmark responses.

Description

The algorithm evaluates how well LLM-generated responses match key predefined keywords from benchmark answers by combining exact and fuzzy string matching techniques. It works as follows:
	•	Preprocessing: Converts the input keyword list to lowercase and removes extra spaces for uniformity.
	•	Tokenization: Extracts valid words from the text using regular expressions, ignoring case.
	•	Exact Matching: Checks for direct word-to-word matches between keywords and tokenized text.
	•	Fuzzy Matching: For keywords not found exactly, uses the RapidFuzz library to calculate similarity scores based on Levenshtein distance. Matches exceeding a defined threshold are accepted.
	•	Scoring: Computes the final matching percentage as the ratio of matched keywords to the total number of keywords.

This hybrid approach enhances the robustness of response evaluation by accounting for minor spelling variations and typos while maintaining precision.
